The app will:

1. Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
2. Allow user to change sort order via a setting:

3. Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
	* original title
	* movie poster image thumbnail
	* A plot synopsis
